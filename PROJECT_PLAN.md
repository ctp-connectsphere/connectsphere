# Project Plan: Campus Connect

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Campus Connect project, a student study partner matching application. This plan is structured as a comprehensive to-do list for AI assistants to follow when implementing the code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

**MVP Recommendation:** For faster initial launch, consider focusing on a leaner MVP consisting of:
- **Phase 1:** Project Foundation & Infrastructure
- **Phase 2:** Authentication System  
- **Phase 3:** Core User Features
- **Phase 4:** Core Matching Algorithm (Epic 11-12 only)
- **Phase 6:** Essential Testing (Epic 19-20)

Defer Phase 5 (Real-time Features) and advanced Phase 4 features until post-MVP.

## üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scope

For rapid initial deployment, focus on these essential components:

### Core MVP Features:
- ‚úÖ User registration and authentication
- ‚úÖ Basic profile management
- ‚úÖ Course enrollment system
- ‚úÖ Simple availability grid
- ‚úÖ Core matching algorithm
- ‚úÖ Basic connection requests (without real-time messaging)
- ‚úÖ Essential testing and deployment

### MVP Exclusions (Post-Launch):
- Real-time messaging and notifications
- Advanced connection management
- Online status and presence
- Comprehensive analytics
- Advanced filtering and search
- Mobile app optimization

## üé® Design Philosophy

- This section outlines the core design principles that will guide the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of Campus Connect. The goal is to create an application that is not only functional but also intuitive, elegant, and enjoyable to use.

- Clarity & Simplicity: The interface must be clean, uncluttered, and easy to understand at a glance. Every element on the screen must serve a clear purpose. We will avoid unnecessary visual noise and complexity, embracing "less is more."

- Intuitive & Effortless: The user's journey should be logical and predictable. Users should be able to achieve their goals (like finding a partner or setting their schedule) with the minimum number of steps and without needing instructions.

- Consistency: We will maintain strict consistency in design patterns, color palettes, typography, and component behavior across the entire application. A button or icon should always look and behave the same way, creating a reliable and familiar experience.

- Feedback & Responsiveness: The application must provide immediate and clear feedback for every user action. This includes loading states, success messages, validation errors, and button-press effects. The interface should feel fast, fluid, and responsive.

- Aesthetic Deference: The design should be modern and aesthetically pleasing, but it must defer to the content. The UI's primary role is to present the user's information‚Äîtheir profile, courses, and potential matches‚Äîin the clearest way possible, without competing for attention. We will use ample whitespace, clean typography, and a limited color palette to achieve a professional and focused look.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies and Order
- **Phase 1** must be completed before any other phases
- **Phase 2** (Authentication) must be completed before Phase 3
- **Phase 3** (Core Features) must be completed before Phase 4
- **Phase 4** (Matching) can be developed in parallel with Phase 5
- **Phase 5** (Real-time) depends on Phase 4 completion
- **Phase 6** (Testing) should be implemented throughout all phases
- **Phase 7** (Deployment) depends on all previous phases
- **Phase 8** (Documentation) can be done in parallel with Phase 7

### Technology Stack Reference
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching:** Upstash Redis
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5
- **Real-time:** Pusher
- **File Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Email:** Resend
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics + Sentry

### Key Files to Reference
- **Database Schema:** `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- **API Reference:** `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`
- **Architecture Decisions:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- **Testing Guide:** `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- **Deployment Guide:** `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Technical Documentation:** `docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### Success Criteria
- All user stories must have working functionality
- All tasks must include proper error handling and validation
- All code must follow the established patterns and conventions
- All features must be tested with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- All security requirements must be met
- Performance targets must be achieved (< 200ms API response time)
- The application must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly

### Developer Notes
- **Task Tagging:** Tasks are tagged as `[Backend]` or `[Frontend]` to indicate primary responsibility, but Next.js App Router blurs these lines. Some "Backend" tasks involve frontend components and vice versa.
- **Scope Management:** This is a comprehensive plan. Consider implementing in iterations, starting with the MVP scope outlined above.
- **Testing Strategy:** Implement testing throughout development, not just at the end. Each epic should include test implementation.
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation files as you implement features.
