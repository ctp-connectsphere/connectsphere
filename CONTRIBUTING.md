## üîß Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/connectsphere.git`
3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ctp-connectsphere/connectsphere.git`

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Follow the existing code style and patterns
3. Test your changes locally
4. Commit your changes with clear messages

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Examples:
```

Implement filtering functionality for events by category type.
Closes #123
```

### Code Style

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow ESLint configurations
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await over promises when possible

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use TypeScript for prop types
- Follow React best practices

#### CSS
- Use meaningful class names
- Follow BEM or similar naming convention
- Prefer utility classes when appropriate

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test edge cases

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include inline comments for complex logic

### Pull Request Process

1. Update your branch with the latest from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/develop
   ```

2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request:
