## ADR-001: Next.js vs Separate Backend

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Technical Team  

### Context

We need to decide between two architectural approaches:
1. **Monolithic Next.js:** Single application with Server Components, Server Actions, and API Routes
2. **Hybrid Architecture:** Next.js frontend + separate backend service (Express/Fastify)

### Decision

We will use a **pure Next.js 14+ architecture** with App Router as the primary approach:

- **Server Components** for data fetching and rendering
- **Server Actions** for mutations and form handling
- **API Routes** only for external integrations and webhooks
- **Vercel hosting** for complete serverless deployment

### Rationale

**Advantages:**
- **Simplified deployment:** Single service to deploy and manage
- **Better developer experience:** Unified codebase, shared types, seamless integration
- **Cost efficiency:** Serverless functions scale to zero
- **Performance:** Edge runtime and automatic optimizations
- **Type safety:** End-to-end TypeScript with shared types
- **Modern patterns:** Leverages latest React and Next.js features

**Trade-offs:**
- **Vendor lock-in:** Tightly coupled to Vercel (mitigated by Next.js portability)
- **Serverless limitations:** Cold starts and execution time limits
- **Complex background jobs:** May need external services for long-running tasks

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development cycles
- Reduced operational complexity
- Better performance through edge deployment
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline
- Lower infrastructure costs

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for team unfamiliar with Server Actions
- Potential limitations for complex background processing
- Dependency on Vercel ecosystem

## ADR-002: Database Technology Stack

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Technical Team  

### Context

We need to choose the database technology and hosting solution for storing user data, courses, availability, and messaging.

### Decision

We will use:
- **PostgreSQL 15+** as the primary database
- **Neon** as the hosting provider (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Prisma** as the ORM and migration tool
- **Upstash Redis** for caching and session storage

### Rationale

**PostgreSQL:**
- **ACID compliance** for data integrity
- **JSON support** for flexible data structures
- **Full-text search** capabilities
- **Mature ecosystem** with excellent tooling

**Neon:**
- **Serverless scaling** - pay only for what you use
- **Branching capabilities** for database versioning
- **Automatic backups** and point-in-time recovery
- **Connection pooling** built-in

**Prisma:**
- **Type-safe queries** with TypeScript integration
- **Migration management** with version control
- **Query optimization** and performance monitoring
- **Excellent developer experience**

**Upstash Redis:**
- **Serverless Redis** - no infrastructure management
- **Global edge locations** for low latency
- **Rate limiting** and caching capabilities
- **Compatible with Vercel** serverless functions

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong consistency and data integrity
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Automatic scaling and backups
- Global performance optimization
- Cost-effective for variable workloads

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for Prisma
- Potential cold start latency
- Dependency on external services

## ADR-003: Authentication Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Technical Team  

### Context

We need to implement secure authentication for university students, with potential for future SSO integration.

### Decision

We will use **NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)** with the following configuration:
- **Credentials provider** for email/password authentication
- **JWT sessions** stored in Upstash Redis
- **Email verification** via Resend
- **Password reset** functionality
- **Future-ready** for SSO integration

### Rationale

**NextAuth.js v5:**
- **Built for Next.js** with excellent integration
- **Multiple providers** supported out of the box
- **Secure by default** with CSRF protection
- **TypeScript support** with generated types
- **Session management** with automatic refresh

**JWT + Redis:**
- **Stateless authentication** suitable for serverless
- **Fast session validation** via Redis cache
- **Automatic expiration** and cleanup
- **Scalable** across multiple edge locations

**Email verification:**
- **University email validation** ensures legitimate users
- **Resend integration** for reliable email delivery
- **Professional email templates**

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Secure and industry-standard authentication
- Easy to extend with additional providers
- Excellent developer experience
- Built-in security features

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity for email verification
- Dependency on email service provider
- Learning curve for team unfamiliar with NextAuth.js

## ADR-004: Real-time Communication

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Technical Team  

### Context

We need real-time messaging between study partners and notifications for connection requests.

### Decision

We will use **Pusher** for real-time communication with the following setup:
- **Pusher Channels** for 1-on-1 messaging
- **Server-sent events** as fallback for basic notifications
- **Message queuing** for offline message delivery

### Rationale

**Pusher:**
- **Serverless-friendly** - no WebSocket server to manage
- **Global edge network** for low latency
- **Built-in scaling** and reliability
- **Rich feature set** - presence, typing indicators, etc.
- **Excellent documentation** and developer experience

**Alternative considered:** Socket.io
- **Rejected** due to serverless incompatibility
- **Would require** separate WebSocket server
- **Adds complexity** to deployment and scaling

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No infrastructure management for real-time features
- Global low-latency messaging
- Rich real-time features out of the box
- Easy to implement and maintain

**Negative:**
- Additional cost for message volume
- Dependency on external service
- Potential vendor lock-in

## ADR-005: Caching Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Technical Team  

### Context

We need to optimize performance for frequently accessed data like user profiles, course lists, and match results.

### Decision

We will implement a **multi-layer caching strategy**:
- **Next.js built-in caching** for Server Components
- **Upstash Redis** for application-level caching
- **Vercel Edge caching** for static content
- **Database query result caching** for expensive operations

### Caching Layers

1. **Browser Cache:** Static assets and API responses
2. **Vercel Edge:** CDN caching for global content
3. **Next.js Cache:** Server Component and API route caching
4. **Redis Cache:** Application data and session storage
5. **Database:** Query result caching and connection pooling

### Cache TTL Strategy

- **Match results:** 5 minutes (frequently changing)
- **User profiles:** 15 minutes (moderately stable)
- **Course data:** 1 hour (relatively stable)
- **University data:** 24 hours (rarely changes)
- **Static content:** 1 year (with versioning)

### Rationale

**Multi-layer approach:**
- **Reduces database load** for frequently accessed data
- **Improves response times** through edge caching
- **Scales automatically** with serverless architecture
- **Cost-effective** - cache hit ratio reduces compute costs

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Significant performance improvements
- Reduced database load and costs
- Better user experience with faster loading
- Automatic scaling with traffic

**Negative:**
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Potential stale data issues
- Additional monitoring requirements

### Decision

We will use **Vercel** as the primary hosting platform with the following setup:
- **Vercel Edge Network** for global deployment
- **Preview deployments** for each PR
- **Environment-specific configurations**
- **Automatic scaling** and performance monitoring

### Architecture
