# Shared Resources

This directory contains shared code, constants, types, and utilities used by both frontend and backend.

## Structure

- **constants/** - Shared constant values and enums
- **types/** - TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **utils/** - Utility functions used across the application

## Usage

When adding shared code:
1. Ensure it's truly needed by both frontend and backend
2. Keep dependencies minimal
3. Document any complex logic
4. Consider using TypeScript for better type safety
